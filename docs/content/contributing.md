# Development

This page is for contributors working on Delta Arrow Reader itself. Applications
that use the crate can start with the [installation guide](../public/installation.md).

## Run the local checks

The repository CI tests every supported feature combination. Run these focused
checks before opening a pull request:

```console
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --locked --all-features --no-deps
cargo package --locked
```

## Build the Python package locally

For source installation and a table reading example, see the
[Python installation guide](../public/installation.md#python).

To build and test the wheel directly, run these commands from the repository
root on Linux or macOS:

```console
python3 -m venv target/python-venv
. target/python-venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install 'maturin>=1.14,<2'
maturin build --locked --manifest-path crates/delta-arrow-reader-python/Cargo.toml --out target/python-wheels
python -m pip install --force-reinstall target/python-wheels/*.whl
python -I -m unittest discover -s crates/delta-arrow-reader-python/tests
cargo test --locked -p delta-arrow-reader-python
```

The isolated Python check imports the installed wheel without adding the current
directory to its import path. Default Cargo commands still select the core crate;
use `cargo check -p delta-arrow-reader-python` to check the binding crate directly.

The binding's runtime owner lives in `crates/delta-arrow-reader-python/src/runtime.rs`.
Table loading, scan planning, and batch reads use its `wait` method, which releases
the GIL during bounded waits and checks Python signals on the calling thread.
An interruption drops the pending future; synchronous
Kernel work already running may still finish. The last runtime owner starts
shutdown without waiting for that blocking work.

The Rust tests cover retained ownership and shutdown from a runtime worker.
On POSIX systems, the Python runtime test delays a local HTTP response while
loading a table in a subprocess, sends SIGINT, and checks for `KeyboardInterrupt`
and clean process exit. The HTTP handler also verifies that another Python thread
can run during loading.

## Work on the documentation

The Markdown files in `docs/public/` are the source for the documentation
site. The guides listed in `src/guides.rs` are also included in the generated
Rust documentation.

Use absolute links between shared pages. Mark runnable Rust examples as
`no_run`, and mark incomplete snippets as `ignore`, so both documentation
renderers handle them correctly.

Install the documentation dependencies, then build or serve the site:

```console
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python -m zensical build --strict -f docs/mkdocs.yml
python -m zensical serve -f docs/mkdocs.yml
```
