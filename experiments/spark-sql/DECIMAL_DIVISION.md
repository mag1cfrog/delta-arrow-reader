# Decimal division patch evaluation

The division core and numeric/NULL operand coercion from [Sail PR 2225](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/pull/2225) fix the frozen `2 / 3` rounding discrepancy and the tested mixed-numeric division cases without adding a crate or execution node. They do not provide complete Spark division semantics. The candidate is saved as an optional patch; the normal vendored source and its checkpoint remain unchanged.

## Candidate and provenance

The PR revision evaluated is `c9fda1f3281d383ee0efbd371d2b43d957d01939`, which was open and unmerged when checked on September 14, 2026. Its [division expression](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/blob/c9fda1f3281d383ee0efbd371d2b43d957d01939/crates/sail-plan/src/function/scalar/math.rs#L1373) and [decimal type rules](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/blob/c9fda1f3281d383ee0efbd371d2b43d957d01939/crates/sail-plan/src/function/decimal.rs) are covered by Sail's Apache-2.0 [license](vendor/sail/LICENSE).

`decimal-division.patch` adds 249 Rust lines, including comments and blank lines, to the existing math planner. The rounding-only candidate committed in `b6f437c` added 101 lines; this revision adds another 148 for operand coercion. It copies eight helper bodies unchanged from the pinned PR: decimal/float classification, integer-width mapping, integer literal narrowing, decimal peer coercion and division's asymmetric NULL coercion. A local adapter selects these numeric/NULL paths for `/`, before the existing divisor guard. The PR's general arithmetic/string dispatcher is omitted.

The Decimal128/Decimal128 match arm and its type helpers still come from the first candidate. The final ANSI-dependent cast is inlined. The experiment uses `allowPrecisionLoss=true` and `literal.pickMinimumPrecision=true`, matching Spark's defaults. The copied helpers retain their false branches, but configuration plumbing and those non-default modes are not evaluated.

The expression calculates Spark's result precision and scale, preserves an extra digit during division, rounds HALF_UP, and casts to the result type. It uses DataFusion/Arrow's existing Decimal128 kernel when the intermediate fits, and Decimal256 otherwise. No UDF, physical node, dependency or version upgrade is introduced.

The PR's string coercion, configuration plumbing, other arithmetic operators and snapshot changes are not included. Decimal256 source columns and negative decimal scales are not tested. This evaluates a reusable subset, not the complete PR. The patch applies to the vendored source at host commit `5d17c785d36b387090c4a28e0115a90fdeab267f`, unchanged in `b6f437c`, and is not part of `upstream.patch`.

## Results

`decimal-division.jsonl` contains 57 queries, each run with ANSI enabled and disabled. The original 33 queries are unchanged. Another 24 cover integer widths, typed and negative literals, integer limits, reversed operands, float peers, NULLs and excluded-path controls. Together they cover column and literal operands, signs, halfway rounding, zeros, precision capping, result overflow, scales from 0 to 38 and a composed ROUND expression. The Rust probe uses batch size 1 and two target partitions. Apache Spark 4.2.0 supplies the independent reference. Rust uses the existing DataFusion 54.1.0 / Arrow 58.4.0 lockfile.

| Value/type or error-stage agreement with Spark | Unmodified vendor | Rounding only | With numeric/NULL coercion |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Original 33 queries, both ANSI modes | 14/66 | 47/66 | 55/66 |
| Expanded 57 queries, both ANSI modes | 18/114 | 51/114 | 97/114 |

All eight original mixed-integer/untyped-NULL disagreements are resolved. None of the 51 observations agreeing with Spark under the rounding-only candidate lose agreement. The string and other-operator controls remain byte-for-byte unchanged between the candidates.

These counts exclude field names, nullability, metadata and structured error conditions. Decimal values are compared exactly without converting through float or rounding to Python's default decimal precision. Captures embed their SQL cases, and the comparison rejects stale SQL and missing, duplicate or reordered IDs. The Rust probe now records parser/analyzer failures as planning errors and continues with subsequent cases. Matching an error stage alone does not establish matching error semantics.

The original 116-query Delta corpus matches the rounding-only candidate in every observation. Relative to the lifecycle checkpoint, only `arithmetic_decimal_division` changes: the `2 / 3` row becomes `0.666667` instead of `0.666666`. The repaired case still differs from Spark in generated field names and metadata, so the strict Spark summary remains 47 matches / 58 differences / 11 pending host-adapter cases. The four frozen corpus/baseline files are unchanged.

The expanded probe leaves 17 disagreements:

| Cases, across ANSI modes | Count | What remains |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Scale-37/38 self-division, including the largest scale-38 input | 6 | Decimal256's rescaled numerator overflows although Spark returns `1.000000`. The PR itself records this limitation. |
| NULL numerator with a zero column under ANSI, and literal zero under both modes | 3 | Existing guards raise too early or return an untyped NULL. This subset does not replace the guards. |
| ROUND applied to the quotient | 2 | The value is `0.67`, but ROUND retains the wrong decimal precision. The PR also lists ROUND's result type as a separate gap. |
| Minimum BIGINT literal, both modes | 2 | Sail analysis rejects `-9223372036854775808L` before division planning. The probe records this existing failure rather than aborting the capture. |
| String divisor control, both modes | 2 | The PR's string conversion path is deliberately omitted; this control retains the old failure or result. |
| Addition/multiplication control, both modes | 2 | These operators retain their existing decimal type differences. The division adapter does not change them. |

The high-scale failure is value-dependent. A very small `DECIMAL(38,38)` value divided by itself succeeds; `0.5 / 0.5` at the same type overflows. Rejecting or accepting solely by the declared type would therefore be a separate support-policy decision.

## Reproduce

Use the Rust and Spark environments from the [experiment README](README.md). Set `SPARK_TEST_PYTHON` to the full PySpark 4.2.0 environment, and set `JAVA_HOME` if needed. Run from the repository root. Reuse the same Cargo target directory for all Rust commands.

```bash
mkdir -p target/spark-sql/decimal-division
"$SPARK_TEST_PYTHON" experiments/spark-sql/decimal_division.py spark \
  target/spark-sql/decimal-division/spark.json
cargo run --locked --manifest-path experiments/spark-sql/Cargo.toml \
  --example decimal_probe -- experiments/spark-sql/decimal-division.jsonl \
  target/spark-sql/decimal-division/baseline.json

git apply --check experiments/spark-sql/decimal-division.patch
git apply experiments/spark-sql/decimal-division.patch
cargo run --locked --manifest-path experiments/spark-sql/Cargo.toml \
  --example decimal_probe -- experiments/spark-sql/decimal-division.jsonl \
  target/spark-sql/decimal-division/candidate.json
git apply -R experiments/spark-sql/decimal-division.patch

python3 experiments/spark-sql/decimal_division.py compare \
  target/spark-sql/decimal-division/spark.json \
  target/spark-sql/decimal-division/baseline.json \
  --report target/spark-sql/decimal-division/baseline-check.json
python3 experiments/spark-sql/decimal_division.py compare \
  target/spark-sql/decimal-division/spark.json \
  target/spark-sql/decimal-division/candidate.json \
  --report target/spark-sql/decimal-division/candidate-check.json
```

Both comparison commands currently return exit 1 because differences remain. Reverse the optional patch even if the candidate command fails. The checked-in test protects exact Decimal comparison and rejects captures from changed SQL:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s experiments/spark-sql -p test_decimal_division.py
```

The next bounded step is to evaluate NULL/zero behavior. High-scale arithmetic still needs explicit treatment before general Spark division support can be claimed. String conversion and other operators remain separate work; importing the entire arithmetic PR would expand scope without resolving all of these gaps. This evaluation does not close the adoption decision in the owning issue.
